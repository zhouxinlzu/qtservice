## Qt Solutions Component: Service
The **`QtService`** component is useful for developing Windows services
and Unix daemons.<br>
*wangwenx190: Some modifications were made to meet my personal needs.*

### Version history
2.0
- Reimplemented for Qt 4 with improved API.

2.1
- More feedback while installing / uninstalling.
- Unix: Documentation about installing service improved.
- Windows: Added account and password arguments to install().
- Windows: Report status correcty when stopping through the controller.
- Windows: Send command IDs correctly.

2.2
- Unix: logMessage() works properly with '%' characters.
- Windows: Dependency on the QtGui library removed.

2.3
- Unix: Using QProcess in a service no longer leaves zombie processes around.
- Windows: Place controller's receiver object in proper thread. (makes QtService work with Qt 4.2).
- Compilation fixes for MinGW.

2.4
- Windows: Do net require Administrator privileges just to start service.
- Improved command-line help text.
- Document the caveats of using GUI services, including that Vista does not support it.
- Added -w(ait) argument to controller example.
